Part II

5. Create a functionality where if we search for a particular image with an id in the input, only that image is available on screen

Create a state hook on the input with the onChange and value. Initialize the state with the complete container of images, so we see all the image son teh screen. 

Make a new function called 'searchImage' which updates the state and return the particular item searched for. 

6. If we click on the button "Shades of Blue" the images on that category are the ones visible on screen.. It filters that array and returns only lightBlue, Blue, Indigo, Purple.

7. According to what is typed in the input field the h3 text changes too.
